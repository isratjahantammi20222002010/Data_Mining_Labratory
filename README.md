# 🎬 Data Mining Laboratory

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my *Data Mining course. The main objective was to analyze and classify movie comments collected from multiple sources using various **machine learning algorithms*.

I gathered comments from *7 different websites* and performed *sentiment analysis* to classify them into:
- Positive 😊  
- Negative 😞  
- Neutral 😐  

## ⚙ Methodology
1. *Data Collection*: Scraped and aggregated comments from 7 websites.  
2. *Preprocessing*: Cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized the dataset.  
3. *Model Implementation*:  
   - Random Forest 🌳  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 📈  
   - Multinomial Logistic Regression 🔢  
4. *Evaluation*: Compared algorithms based on accuracy and performance metrics.

## 📊 Results
- Random Forest: XX% accuracy  
- SVM: XX% accuracy  
- Multinomial Regression: XX% accuracy  

(You can update the accuracy results after running experiments.)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Python*  
- *Scikit-learn*  
- *Pandas*  
- *NumPy*  
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn*
